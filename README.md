# advent-of-code
wlpj2011's advent of code solutions. Starting with 2024, but will probably add others very very slowly. Starting off with Python and trying out mypy for the first time. Adding 2023 in Rust now to practice the basics of Rust that I have learned.

## Current progress 
* 2015 
  * Python - 1 :star:
* 2016 
* 2017
* 2018
* 2019
* 2020
* 2021
* 2022
* 2023 
  * Rust - 12 :star:
  * 5b needs a better solution current solution works but takes ~3 hours to run. Could probably do something based on comparing intervals directly with some sort of binary splitting to narrow down the overlap point.
* 2024 
  * Python - 11 :star:
* 2025 - Forthcoming
